Step 1: Read the challenge carefully. It mentions something about displaying digit '4' in an logic circuit.

Step 2: Apply 'cat' command on file i.e. 'final_assignment' OR change its extention to '.txt' to check the content inside.

It looks something like this!

Step 3: From the same, we can get idea about how to open this file for further investigation. I just copy pasted first few lines directly on the Google.

The First link is of some Repo on Github (https://github.com/NenadPantelic/Simple-digital-logic-circuits-in-LogiSim/blob/master/README.md), from which we can further see we need to use 'LogiSim simulation tool' to view our file.
# Another important thing to note LogiSim open '.circ', so simply change the extension of file to same.

Step 4: Download LogiSim and Open the file i.e. 'final_assignment.circ' onto same.

which will look like this.

Step 5: Read the Question carefully it <says to display digit '4' in the 7-digit display of the given circuit>.

Doing the same will look something like this.

Step 6: Convert the binary given to text using any online convertor.

Step 7: Put the following in the prescribed format as mentioned in the question giving the flag.
